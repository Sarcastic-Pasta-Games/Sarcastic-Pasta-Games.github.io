They are responsible for creating this website as well as porting The Boss's codebase to RPG Maker MV.
In addition they have found a way to use the Floss framework to test the code and some of the event 
details, along with allowing Typescript type definitions to be integrated into the codebase increasing 
clarification. Riley's primary goal is to be an excellent programmer and to have several finished projects under
their belt. When not working on code, this individual enjoys listening to video game music, playing casual games,
listening to upbeat pop songs, watching interesting Let's Plays and animations on YouTube, and hanging out with their friends
