From an early age, she could best be described as spirited and creative, constantly writing stories and participating in community theater.

She went on to found Sarcastic Pasta Games and, after leading development for nine months, she released The BOSS in August 2017, to very positive reviews.
Katie currently leads the development of a sequel to The BOSS.
