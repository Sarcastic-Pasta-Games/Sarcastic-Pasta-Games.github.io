A traveller of the world (but citizen of the United States), Jessica Zimmerman graduated summa cum laude from Wright State University in 2011, with a degree in broadcasting. While she originally wanted to work with video game music back in high school, trepidation over the prospect of having to audition for the university music school redirected her path. It wasnâ€™t until October of 2016 when Katie Pedneau invited her to work on The BOSS that Jessica came to realize she was right back on the path she originally wanted to be on: working on video games. She currently lives with her family and a mountain of dust bunnies that have colonized in her room. Her hobbies and passions include digital art, writing, music, Japanese language and culture, anatomical hearts and heartbeats, mermaids, miniatures, travel, international beverages, her YouTube channel, and,

of course, video games.
