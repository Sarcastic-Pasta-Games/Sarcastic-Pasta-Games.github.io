Ace Ayala is an American artist who was born and raised in Texas. Having joined Sarcastic Pasta Games in the last few weeks of The BOSS's creation to aid in coloring, they have since stuck with the team as an artist for various tasks. By working for SPG, Ace has already begun on the path to fulfilling their dream of becoming a game designer. Ace also aspires to be a marine biologist, hoping to major in this field and pursue game development as a more personal project. They hope to continue working for and alongside the team of Sarcastic Pasta Games and is grateful for the opportunity presented to learn and grow in such an uplifting and supportive environment.
