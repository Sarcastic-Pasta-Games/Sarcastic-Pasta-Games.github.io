Dumbasticart is a hobbyist artist and adores the thought of having her art in a game. So much, that she decided to make art more than a hobby and turn it into her job. This path is still uncovered yet, but she believes the experience from SPG will come in handy. Hopefully this newbie can stay with the group for a long time and can continue to make sprites for them!
