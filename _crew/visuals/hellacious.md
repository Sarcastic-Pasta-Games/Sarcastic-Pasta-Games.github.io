HellaciousSeer is a digital artist, writer, and aspiring video game designer who was born and currently lives in the USA. Being in the class of 18, she is self taught and either caught up in creating art or studying to be a chemical engineer. She finds no greater pleasure than drawing and writing stories she hopes to publish one day.  She goes by either Hella or Seer and dreams of making a game of her own, but until she figures out how to actually do that, she's focused intently on SPG's projects.
