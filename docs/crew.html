        <h4>Katie Pedneau</h4>
        <p><p>Katie Pedneau was born and raised in Montgomery County, Maryland. 
From an early age, she could best be described as spirited and creative, constantly writing stories and participating in community theater. 
She always wanted a creative job that utilized her natural leadership skills, but it wasn’t until she was inspired to make The BOSS that she discovered that game development was her true passion.
She went on to found Sarcastic Pasta Games and, after leading development for nine months, she released The BOSS in August 2017, to very positive reviews.
Katie currently leads the development of a sequel to The BOSS. 
She also has an A.A.S. in Computer Gaming and Simulation from Montgomery College, and is looking to get a bachelor’s in English at University of Maryland. 
In her spare time, she enjoys writing stories, singing, acting, and spending time with friends.</p>
</p>
      
    
      
        <h4>Jessica Zimmerman</h4>
        <p><p>A traveller of the world (but citizen of the United States), Jessica Zimmerman graduated summa cum laude from Wright State University in 2011, with a degree in broadcasting. While she originally wanted to work with video game music back in high school, trepidation over the prospect of having to audition for the university music school redirected her path. It wasn’t until October of 2016 when Katie Pedneau invited her to work on The BOSS that Jessica came to realize she was right back on the path she originally wanted to be on: working on video games. She currently lives with her family and a mountain of dust bunnies that have colonized in her room. Her hobbies and passions include digital art, writing, music, Japanese language and culture, anatomical hearts and heartbeats, mermaids, miniatures, travel, international beverages, her YouTube channel, and,</p>

<p>of course, video games.</p>

          <h4>Ace</h4>
          <p><p>Ace Ayala is an American artist who was born and raised in Texas. Having joined Sarcastic Pasta Games in the last few weeks of The BOSS’s creation to aid in coloring, they have since stuck with the team as an artist for various tasks. By working for SPG, Ace has already begun on the path to fulfilling their dream of becoming a game designer. Ace also aspires to be a marine biologist, hoping to major in this field and pursue game development as a more personal project. They hope to continue working for and alongside the team of Sarcastic Pasta Games and is grateful for the opportunity presented to learn and grow in such an uplifting and supportive environment.</p>
</p>
        
    
        
          <h4>Dumbasticart</h4>
          <p><p>Dumbasticart is a hobbyist artist and adores the thought of having her art in a game. So much, that she decided to make art more than a hobby and turn it into her job. This path is still uncovered yet, but she believes the experience from SPG will come in handy. Hopefully this newbie can stay with the group for a long time and can continue to make sprites for them!</p>
</p>
        
    
        
          <h4>HellaciousSeer</h4>
          <p><p>HellaciousSeer is a digital artist, writer, and aspiring video game designer who was born and currently lives in the USA. Being in the class of 18, she is self taught and either caught up in creating art or studying to be a chemical engineer. She finds no greater pleasure than drawing and writing stories she hopes to publish one day.  She goes by either Hella or Seer and dreams of making a game of her own, but until she figures out how to actually do that, she’s focused intently on SPG’s projects.</p>
</p>
        
    
        
          <h4>Oonagh Mahoney​</h4>
          <p><p>Oonagh Mahoney is an artist and aspiring game developer from New Jersey. She joined Sarcastic Pasta Games in April 2017 as a spriter, and is attending The College of New Jersey to continue her path in art and game development. Oonagh is especially grateful to the JackSepticEye community for their steadfast support to SPG and hopes to be able to create more content for them and many others in the future!</p>
</p>
        
    
        
          <h4>Jessica Love</h4>
          <p><p>Jessica Love (also known as SíoraíDragon online) is a young college student studying animation at Missouri State University. She joined the team just after The BOSS was released and is currently helping on the art and animation aspects of The BOSS is Nothing and Glitch in the System. She hopes to continue working with such great people at Sarcastic Pasta and hopes you enjoy what she contributes!</p>
