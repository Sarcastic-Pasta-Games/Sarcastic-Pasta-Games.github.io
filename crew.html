      Leadership
    </h3>
    <h4>
      Katie Pedneau
    </h4>
    <p>
      Katie Pedneau was born and raised in Montgomery County, Maryland. From an early age, she could best be described
      as <br />
      spirited and creative, constantly writing stories and participating in community theater. She always wanted a
      creative<br />
      job that utilized her natural leadership skills, but it wasn't until she was inspired to make The BOSS that
      she<br />
      discovered that game development was her true passion. She went on to found Sarcastic Pasta Games and, after
      leading<br />
      development for nine months, she released The BOSS in August 2017, to very positive reviews. Katie currently leads
      the<br />
      development of a sequel to The BOSS. She also has an A.A.S. in Computer Gaming and Simulation from Montgomery
      College,<br />
      and is looking to get a bachelor's in English at University of Maryland. In her spare time, she enjoys writing
      stories,<br />
      singing, acting, and spending time with friends.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Jessica Zimmerman
    </h4>
    <p>
      A traveller of the world (but citizen of the United States), Jessica Zimmerman graduated summa cum laude from
      Wright<br />
      State University in 2011, with a degree in broadcasting. While she originally wanted to work with video game music
      back<br />
      in high school, trepidation over the prospect of having to audition for the university music school redirected her
      path.<br />
      It wasn’t until October of 2016 when Katie Pedneau invited her to work on The BOSS that Jessica came to realize
      she was<br />
      right back on the path she originally wanted to be on: working on video games. She currently lives with her family
      and a<br />
      mountain of dust bunnies that have colonized in her room. Her hobbies and passions include digital art, writing,
      music,<br />
      Japanese language and culture, anatomical hearts and heartbeats, mermaids, miniatures, travel, international
      beverages,<br />
      her YouTube channel, and,<br />
      of course, video games.

    <h4>
      HellaciousSeer
    </h4>
    <p>
      HellaciousSeer is a digital artist, writer, and aspiring video game designer who was born and currently lives in
      the
      USA. <br /> Being in the class of 18, she is self taught and either caught up in creating art or studying to be a
      chemical
      engineer.<br /> She finds no greater pleasure than drawing and writing stories she hopes to publish one day. She
      goes by either Hella or<br />Seer and dreams of making a game of her own, but until she figures out how to
      actually do that,
      she's focused intently on <br /> SPG's projects.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Jessica Love
    </h4>
    <p>
      Jessica Love (also known as SíoraíDragon online) is a young college student studying animation at Missouri
      State<br />
      University. She joined the team just after The BOSS was released and is currently helping on the art and
      animation<br />
      aspects of The BOSS is Nothing and Glitch in the System. She hopes to continue working with such great people
      at<br />
      Sarcastic Pasta and hopes you enjoy what she contributes!
    </p>
    <h4>
      Kashi's Art
    </h4>
    <p>
      Kashi is a self taught artist going by "Kashi's Art". He has a love/hate relationship with drawing and art and
      describes<br />
      himself as a bit of a masochist. He joined the team after seeing the fan game The BOSS. Now he is helping the
      studio to<br />
      draw each of the characters in the games. He really hopes you enjoy what you see on the screen.<br />
    </p>
    <h4>
      PhoenixIsLost
    </h4>
    <p>
      Surprisingly, not an actual mythological bird. (But probably still needs a map). Phoenix is a mostly self-taught
      artist <br />
      with a focus on digital illustration. He is currently studying illustration at the University of Central Florida
      and <br />
      plans to continue his education in pursuit of higher degrees in art direction and professional application. He has
      a <br />
      genuine love for immersive art, such as theme park design and game design, where it’s possible to be somewhere and
      <br />
      someone else for a day. His ambitions are pretty simple; he just wants to draw and make people smile. Phoenix
      joined SPG <br />
      following a casting call for an artist for The BOSS: Glitch in the System. He almost didn’t apply, due to a lack
      of <br />
      confidence. In the end, he’s glad that he did and is ecstatic to be working with the team. He is currently on
      hiatus.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Ace
    </h4>
    <p>
      Ace Ayala is an American artist who was born and raised in Texas. Having joined Sarcastic Pasta Games in the last
      few <br />
      weeks of The BOSS's creation to aid in coloring, they have since stuck with the team as an artist for various
      tasks. By <br />
      working for SPG, Ace has already begun on the path to fulfilling their dream of becoming a game designer. Ace also
      <br />
      aspires to be a marine biologist, hoping to major in this field and pursue game development as a more personal
      project. <br />
      They hope to continue working for and alongside the team of Sarcastic Pasta Games and is grateful for the
      opportunity <br />
      presented to learn and grow in such an uplifting and supportive environment.

      2017 <br />
      as a spriter, and is attending The College of New Jersey to continue her path in art and game development. Oonagh
      is <br />
      especially grateful to the JackSepticEye community for their steadfast support to SPG and hopes to be able to
      create <br />
      more content for them and many others in the future!
    </p>
    <h4>
      Dumbasticart
    </h4>
    <p>
      Dumbasticart is a hobbyist artist and adores the thought of having her art in a game. So much, that she decided to
      make <br />
      art more than a hobby and turn it into her job. This path is still uncovered yet, but she believes the experience
      from <br />
      SPG will come in handy. Hopefully this newbie can stay with the group for a long time and can continue to make
      sprites <br />
      for them!
