          When Jack sits down to record for the day, his computer doesn't seem to want to cooperate. In fact, it seems
          to
          be<br />
          fighting against him, and he suddenly finds himself pulled back into the weird and wonderful world of
          Wireland!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>But there's something wrong, this time. Something off. Something that seems to be pulling the fragile world
          of
          his<br>
          favorite characters apart at the very seams. It's up to Jack, along with the rest of Possepticeye, to find
          out<br>
          what's
          behind this...or who.<br> Because if they can't, Wireland just might fall prey to...</p>
        <br />
        A Glitch in the System.
