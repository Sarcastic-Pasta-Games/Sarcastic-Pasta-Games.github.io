      Leadership
    </h3>
    <h4>
      Katie Pedneau
    </h4>
    <p>
      Katie Pedneau was born and raised in Montgomery County, Maryland. From an early age, she could best be described
      as <br />
      spirited and creative, constantly writing stories and participating in community theater. She always wanted a
      creative<br />
      job that utilized her natural leadership skills, but it wasn't until she was inspired to make The BOSS that
      she<br />
      discovered that game development was her true passion. She went on to found Sarcastic Pasta Games and, after
      leading<br />
      development for nine months, she released The BOSS in August 2017, to very positive reviews. Katie currently leads
      the<br />
      development of a sequel to The BOSS. She also has an A.A.S. in Computer Gaming and Simulation from Montgomery
      College,<br />
      and is looking to get a bachelor's in English at University of Maryland. In her spare time, she enjoys writing
      stories,<br />
      singing, acting, and spending time with friends.

      Jessica Zimmerman
    </h4>
    <p>
      A traveller of the world (but citizen of the United States), Jessica Zimmerman graduated summa cum laude from
      Wright<br />
      State University in 2011, with a degree in broadcasting. While she originally wanted to work with video game music
      back<br />
      in high school, trepidation over the prospect of having to audition for the university music school redirected her
      path.<br />
      It wasn’t until October of 2016 when Katie Pedneau invited her to work on The BOSS that Jessica came to realize
      she was<br />
      right back on the path she originally wanted to be on: working on video games. She currently lives with her family
      and a<br />
      mountain of dust bunnies that have colonized in her room. Her hobbies and passions include digital art, writing,
      music,<br />
      Japanese language and culture, anatomical hearts and heartbeats, mermaids, miniatures, travel, international
      beverages,<br />
      her YouTube channel, and,<br />
      of course, video games.

      goes by either Hella or<br />Seer and dreams of making a game of her own, but until she figures out how to
      actually do that,
      she's focused intently on <br /> SPG's projects.

      Dumbasticart
    </h4>
    <p>
      Dumbasticart is a hobbyist artist and adores the thought of having her art in a game. So much, that she decided to
      make <br />
      art more than a hobby and turn it into her job. This path is still uncovered yet, but she believes the experience
      from <br />
      SPG will come in handy. Hopefully this newbie can stay with the group for a long time and can continue to make
      sprites <br />
      for them!
